## Description
My project is a Professional README Generator is a command-line application designed to create an high-quality README.md files for your projects on GitHub. Instead of manually crafting READMEs, this tool allows developers to input project details through a series of prompts and generates a structured README file.

The generated README includes sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, licensing information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact details. The application uses the Inquirer package to generates a README file based on their input.
